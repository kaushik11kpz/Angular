->We will be learning about Templating
->Routing
In app.routing.module.ts we import Routes, RouterModule from "@angular/router"
We also import NgModule in this file
The const route declaration is very important in this file
We create array of objects in routes

-> Bootstrap
We install bootstrap in terminal using command - npm install bootstrap
After which bootstrap version will be seen in package.json
In styles.css, we will import bootstrap from node modules using command- @import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
~ -> gives the root directory(node modules)


Disable type checking using $any()
*ngIf checks for truthy and falsy values.
