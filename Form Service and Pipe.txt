--Focus on services***
-Services
-Forms
-Pipes(|)
-Pipes converts the date from one form to other
-It is a very powerful tool

Services-
- Any Modification in the data is done through services
- It is where we keep all our business logic
- Avoids manipulation of data through Component
- Service can be injected using Injectable decorators
- It can be injected at the root level so that all the components below this root(which is at top level) access all the things from the service class

--Using of() operator of rxjs we can make anything observable

--Hook into component lifecycle

--Forms into Angular
1. Reactive Form
-Validation check and alot of things are already done by angular
-More consumig(you have to type more)
2. Template Driven Form
-Manually requires todo alot of things
-Less consuming
-[{ngModel}] is must and it effects specific variables

--Angular Wrapper Element
-ngContent
-mgContainer
-Upper both elements does not bother with css unlike div tag
